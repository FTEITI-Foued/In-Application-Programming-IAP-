# In-Application-Programming-IAP-
The IAP driver contains the following set of source files: 1/-main.c: where the USART initialization and RCC configuration are set. A main menu is then executed from the menu.c file. 2/-menu.c: contains the main menu routine. The main menu gives the options of downloading a new binary file, uploading internal Flash memory, executing the binary file already loaded and managing the write protection of the pages where the user loads the binary file. 3/-flash_if.c: contains write, erase and configure write protection of the internal Flash memory functions. 4/-common.c: contains functions related to read/write from/to USART peripheral. 5/-ymodem.c: used to send and receive the data to and from the terminal emulation application using the Ymodem protocol. In the event of a failure when receiving the data, the “Failed to receive the file” error message is displayed. If the data is successfully received, it is programmed into the internal Flash memory from the appropriate address. A comparison between internal RAM contents and internal Flash memory contents is performed to check the data integrity. If there is any data discrepancy, the “Verification failed” error message is displayed. Other error messages are also displayed when the image file size is greater than the allowed memory space and when the user aborts the task.
